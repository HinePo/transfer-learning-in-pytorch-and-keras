# transfer-learning-in-pytorch-and-keras
ResNet and VGG pytorch and keras examples

This is just a snippet of code that often helps me in my transfer learning projects. It shows:

1. How to load pre-trained models and weights
2. How to delete the model's last layer
3. How to add a new head/top layer

This is not a data example, so there is no train after the above.
